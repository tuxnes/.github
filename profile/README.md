# TuxNES

This organization represents revived development efforts for [TuxNES][1], a NES emulator for Linux with the
GNU GPL License.

## History

The last "official" release of TuxNES was in 2001.  It evidently went unmaintained/abandoned with no public
development from initial authors.

The last release was imported to github by [@turboencabulator][2] in 2014, and in the 2014-2019 period
saw bug fixes there.  This is the basis of the current repo.

This organization was created by [@asveikau][3] in 2023 after additional bugfixes and integrating the HQX scaler.
